 //TODO:
 - Build some kind of form view controller, that we can reuse for forms work in the app
 - Add multiple colums to the card view, it should look like a BINGO card row
- Add a "New Card" Controller (a way to create a new MEgo card
- Build out a way to check for messages & notifications when app goes in background
- Build out a settings screen
- Idea for settings: Build a componentobjects that can allow for different types in the settings screen ex: a toggle, like some options toggle off and on and some may not, eh
 - In the Data Manager in a custom init add observers on user states
 - Add in reporting suite to this app so Summer has data for her marketing
 - Ask her about in app marketing, work with her to create target marketing if applicable
 - Build a API Manager, we will use this directly in the Network Manager for networking calls
 - Add IOC to "getData" method so it can be more universal in going up and grabbing all kinds of data objects instead of multiple one purpose functions
 - Add in a Security Manager, check if user right to access certain parts of the data, like if they have access to the app at all, ie on a banned/suspended list, can also monitor in app status also, like checking user states such as if they are logged in or not, can be also used for SSO parts of the app
 
 UI work
 - Will have a progress bar, which value will be based off CardRatioStatus
- Don't show any progress bars for a card not in "not stared" status
We will use the card work status and card status ratio to modify the card view
Ei: we can sort the cards by status
